# py-windows-screentime
This program will track screen time usage of specific windows as you use your operating system. It has only been tested to work on Windows 10 and doesn't work for other operating systems outside the Windows family.

The purpose is to be a simple demonstration and learning experience for Python's [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) standard library and the Window's User/Kernel APIs.

## Usage

Run the following command:
```shell
python main.py
```

Continue to use your operating system as normal. When ready, press RETURN within the command line to read the results.
